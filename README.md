# Fast File Browser

Is your file browser fast? Really? What about the `ls` command? Isn't it faster than your file browser? Yes, it is! But is `ls` interactive? No, it is not.

This is interactive `ls` command wrapped with `iselect`. That way, you can select and open both files or directories.

That's it.
